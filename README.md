# scrabble_helper
A program to help you find the best word combinations from your rack.

This program was a challenge from [here](http://wiki.openhatch.org/Scrabble_challenge).
A user can input their Scrabble rack and the program will return a list of spellable words with the highest scoring word at the top.


To Use:
In the terminal, run 'python main.py [RACK]' where [RACK] is the letters you have in your rack. Do not include spaces.
